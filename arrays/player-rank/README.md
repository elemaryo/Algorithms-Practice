## Player Rank

Given player scores [], each player gets ranked 1, 2, 3 ... based on the highest score. Highest - rank 1. 2nd Highest - rank 2 and so on. Tied players and ranked same but next rank will be determined based on number of ties 

Example:

```
Input: scores = [20, 20, 10, 5],  cutoff = 2
Output: 2

```
Because: ranks = [1, 1, 3, 4] - only two people have ranks >= 2
